# Move All Zeroes to End

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

Given an array **arr[]** of non-negative integers, move all the zeros to the end of the array while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements. Perform the operation in place, without using an extra array.

 **Examples:** 

```
Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 0, 4, 3, 0, 5, 0]
Output: [1, 2, 4, 3, 5, 0, 0, 0]
Explanation: The three zeros are moved to the end while the order of the non-zero elements remains unchanged.

```

```
Input: arr[] = [10, 20, 30]
Output: [10, 20, 30]
Explanation: No change in array as there are no 0s.

```

```
Input: arr[] = [0, 0]
Output: [0, 0]
Explanation: No change in array as there are all 0s.
```

```java
class Solution {
    void pushZerosToEnd(int[] arr) {
        // code here
        int n = arr.length;
                int j = 0; // Position for non-zero element

                // Move all non-zero elements to the front
                for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
                    if (arr[i] != 0) {
                        arr[j++] = arr[i];
                    }
                }
                //hello working

                // Fill remaining positions with zeros
                while (j < n) {
                    arr[j++] = 0;
                }
        
    }
}
```
